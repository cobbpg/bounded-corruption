# Bounded Corruption

This piece of wonder is my contribution to the LambdaCube Game Jam, whose core theme was ‘Infection’. In this game you have to spread the word – or menace, if you like – of lambdas as efficiently as possible.

Clicking a spot will start a lambda infection but uses a set amount of power. Waiting for the infection to spread also uses power, but at a slower rate. Try to find the sweet spot for the amount and placement of clicks to minimise the end result.

The third level has some brighter areas where the infection can spread more quickly. Use them to your advantage!
